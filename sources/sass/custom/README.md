custom directory
===

This is a special directory for your custom sass files. Place your own custom files in this directory to protect them from being deleted during updates.

Example
---

    you have a file _productlist.sass in this directory.
    To add this file in your scss file i.e. tvidoo-grid.scss simply put the following line
    in the scss file:
    @import 'custom/productlist';
    Where the best place for this line is, depends on your needs.
