tvidoo grid
===
tvidoo grid is a pure css based fluid grid layout system for all purposes regarding responsive (adaptive) web design. tvidoo grid is brought to you by [Thorsten KÃ¶rner](http://www.tvidoo-commerce.com/en/author/thorsten/) it is pure CSS / CSS3 and don't rely on any JavaScript libraries. So you are absolutely free to combine it with whatever frameworks you want, be it AngularJS, be it jQuery and so many more.

tvidoo grid also don't hurt existing template sets, when you are required to migrate softly to a responsive design.

Contributing
===
Please read the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/tvidoo-commerce/tvidoo-grid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) doc when you are interested in contributing to the tvidoo grid project.

History
===
It was first developed during my work on several responsive shop templates for Magento, OXID and Prestashop online shops, as well as WordPress blogs at [tvidoo commerce](http://www.tvidoo-commerce.com).

After doing several different shops, I decided to strip down the code to have it more generic, so tvidoo grid is strictly designed to have a small footprint.


Installing tvidoo grid
===
### Compile from sources (recomended)
Since compiling the sources gives you the opportunity to make your own settings and design, I recommend this way.
 
Prerequisites:
- ruby (https://www.ruby-lang.org/)
- compass (http://compass-style.org/)
- grunt (http://gruntjs.com)

1. Clone this project (```$> git clone git@github.com:tvidoo-commerce/tvidoo-grid.git```)
2. CD to the project directory (```$> cd /path/tvidoo-grid/```)
3. Run NPM (```$> npm install```). This may take some time now, so go and grab a coffee :-) 
4. Start the automatic compass watcher with ```$> grunt watch```
5. Now, whenever you make changes to one of the source files, the contents of the distribution directory will be rebuilt automatically.
6. Use the compressed contents of the distribution directory in your project. (See Usage section in this file.)

### Distribution | Installing tvidoo grid using a ZIP archive
If you want to install tvidoo grid just as it is, just download the latest ZIP archive release and unpack the contents of the distribution directory to your web project or website.

Prerequisites:
- No special requirements when just using the CSS files.

===

Usage
===
Use the compressed contents of the distribution directory in your project.

	EXAMPLE:
	Load the tvidoo-grid and the desired tvidoo theme in the <head></head> section of your html:
	
         <link rel="stylesheet" href="../../distribution/css/tvidoo-grid.css">
         <link rel="stylesheet" href="../../distribution/css/tvidoo-grid-theme-basic.css">
         
That's it. Now you can use the grid for your design on your website.

Use tvidoo grid for your WordPress theme
===
It is easy to use the tvidoo grid layout system to develop your WordPress theme.

In this case, you have to use a file style.css in the theme's root directory and @import all css files, you want.

Since this is the way, you would normally go, we have a better one. You can simply use the style.scss file in the sources/sass directory and adapt everything to your needs.

Don't forget to edit the comment section at the top according to the WordPress codex. (https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development#Theme_Stylesheet)
